<h1>Survival Maths</h1>
This is a maths game that requires the user to choose whether the second number generated to the screen in higher or lower than the first. The user initially has 3 lives, that can be detracted from by 0.5 increments if an incorrect answer is chosen. The user has a chance to earn back lives in 0.25 increments for every correct answer chosen. 

The user can also keep track of their high score, which will update and save every time the top score is beaten and the game is reset. 

<h2>Colour Palette</h2>
The colours I used were simple and highly contrasting to make sure that the user's attention is not taken away from the game with any other distracting colour choices.
Blue and lightcyan.

<h2>Features</h2>

I added the game's name as a heading with 3 font awesome icons as the game logo, a heart (representing the users lives) trapped between greater and less than signs.

I added a description of the game and its rules so that the user is clear on how the game operates.

I added a dotted border to the game area to keep the user's attention focused on this area once the game had begun. It also breaks up the page to give a clear indication of when the game area starts and the description ends. 

I created buttons, using the same colour scheme as the rest of the page for consistency, to allow the user to make the guesses 'Higher' & 'Lower', as well as two variations of a reset button to allow the user to start the game over with a new set of lives and a cleared score.

<h2>Features for the future</h2>

To add more levels that increase the difficulty. For example, both of the maths formulas could either be multiplication, divison, addition or subtraction. This would mean that the user would have to figure out the sum of for both of the quesitons in the limited time before they disappear from the screen.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
I deployed the site to GitHub by accessing the repository I had created for the project, going into settings and choosing the main branch to deploy from in the Pages section. Any edits I made since the deployment had been committed to the repository.
