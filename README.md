<h1>Memory Maths</h1>
This is a maths game that requires the user to choose whether the second number generated to the screen in higher or lower than the first. The numbers will disappear after a few seconds, so the users will have to use their number comprehension skills, as well as their memorisation skills.

<h2>Colour Palette</h2>
The colours I used were simple and highly contrasting to make sure that the user's attention is not taken away from the game with any other distracting colour choices.

<h2>Features for the future</h2>

To add more levels that increase the difficulty. For example, both of the maths formulas could either be multiplication, divison, addition or subtraction. This would mean that the user would have to figure out the sum of for both of the quesitons in the limited time before they disappear from the screen.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
I deployed the site to GitHub by accessing the repository I had created for the project, going into settings and choosing the main branch to deploy from in the Pages section. Any edits I made since the deployment had been committed to the repository.
